<h1>Just training</h1>

    <p>Today I want to practice a little of programming, I think it's just time to break this line with &lt;br&gt;. <br> You <br> see... <br> The <br> line <br> <h1>BREAK!</h1></p>
    <p>Right now the light is off and I havent internet, so I'm here practicing.</p>
    <p>I will put one line below this pararagraph, if you want to do that you just need to writte &lt;hr&gt; and the magic of HTML happens!</p>

    <p>Look at this above...</p>
    <P>I'm curious about the tag &lt;h2&gt;, how it looks?</P>
    <p>Ok, I will show you this below...</p>
    <h2>Oh! When you write &lt;h2&gt; you see the letters in this size man!</h2>
    <P>Now I will write all sizes of &lth&gt; and you see the diferrence!</P>

    <h3>The &lt;h3&gt; looks in this way.</h3>
    <h4>The &lt;h4&gt; looks in this way.</h4>
    <h5>The &lt;h5&gt; looks in this way.</h5>
    <h6>The &lt;h6&gt; looks in this way.</h6>
